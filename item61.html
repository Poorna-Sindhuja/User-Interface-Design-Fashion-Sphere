★★★★☆ - Jason L.
“Love the look and feel. They run slightly large though, so maybe size down if you're in between.”

★★★☆☆ - Amanda T.
“Good style, but the inner padding could be better. They’re fine for short walks but not all-day wear.”

★★★★★ - Kevin R.
“Really solid shoes! They’ve held up great through city walking and even a bit of rain.”
